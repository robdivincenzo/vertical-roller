To whom it may concern:

Overview: The files in this folder are example pieces of a image roller jQuery plugin.

Goal: The goal of this implementation was to create a rolling gallery of images (with ability to link to pages or the full image). This would be used in one of our websites to showcase some beautiful photos associated with a location.

Technologies: The implementation is written with JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS.

View the Work: The index file contains just a barebones examples of what the gallery could look like. It is put to good use at ourmedicalcity.com
